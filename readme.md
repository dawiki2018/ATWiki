# ATWiki

`TiddlyWiki` for Windows. A unique non-linear notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex information.

Use it to keep your to-do list, to plan an essay or novel, or to organise your wedding. Record every thought that crosses your brain, or build a flexible and responsive website.

Unlike conventional online services, `TiddlyWiki` lets you choose where to keep your data, guaranteeing that in the decades to come you will still be able to use the notes you take today.


`ATWiki` is an independent project of `TiddlyWiki`.
